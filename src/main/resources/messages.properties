welcome.title=Welcome to Blog Teleporter
welcome.intro=If you are here, that means you are interested in moving your blog. I made this app specifically to do that. Currently it just \
moves Drupal blogs onto Tumblr. I plan on supporting other blogs in the near future. Priority is going to be on importing blogs to Tumblr though. \
If you have a blog that you want moved to Tumblr and the Teleporter does not support it yet, just message me and I will push it up on my \
ToDo list. This app is a work in progress so stuff that you think should be here probably deserves to be. Suggestions, ideas, \
and questions are welcomed.
welcome.teleport.label=To get started, click the following link.
welcome.info=The code for this project is available on GitHub. If you want to check it out or send me a message, please go there.

teleporter.tumblr.delete.intro=For convenience, you can also delete posts on your Tumblr blog by tag. This function is important in case you make a \
mistake and need to undone an import. Blog Teleporter tags all posts that it imports. You can use that tag to remove imported posts. To start \
deleting posts, click the following link.    

teleport.drupal.posts.title=Teleport Drupal Posts To Tumblr
teleport.drupal.posts.settings=Specify the Drupal blog that you want to teleport posts from. You will need to identify both the URL for the blog and how \
URLs for posts start. For example, my old Drupal blog's URL was http://chrisjordan.ca/. The URLs for the posts started with \
http://chrisjordan.ca/node/. The blog entry start and end comments are used by the Teleporter to properly extract your posts. You should make these comments \
a phrase that does not appear in your blog at all. For example, ##### BLOG_ENTRY_START ##### and ##### BLOG_ENTRY_END ##### should work most of the time.
teleport.drupal.posts.more.settings=Be sure to set your Drupal theme to Garland. That is the default Drupal theme. Blog Teleporter expects your Drupal blog \
to be using that theme.
